## Getting your NFT artwork to show up in the iFrame

- NFT Route: The contract address and token ID are extracted from the URL parameters `/contractAddress/tokenId`. The `fetchNFTData` function in `app/hooks/index.ts` fetches the NFT data, and the Token Bound Account (TBA) associated with the token ID (used as the salt) is returned.

- TBA Route: The contract address of the TBA is retrieved from the URL parameters `/tokenboundAddress`. The getOwnerNFT function in `app/utils/index.ts` retrieves the owner NFTâ€™s contract address and token ID. The NFT data is then fetched using the fetchNFTData function, also located in `app/utils/index.ts`.
